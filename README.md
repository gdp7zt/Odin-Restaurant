# Odin-Restaurant

In this project, I will be implementing what I learned about webpack to create a restaurant homepage. I will also be creating nearly all of the html using javascript and practicing importing and exporting javascript functions. I also hope to set up the browser to automatically update when I add more code using webpack.
